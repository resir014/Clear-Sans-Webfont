## How to include

### Manually

To use this font, simply put the `fonts` folder in your root directory, and the `clear-sans.css` file on the `css/` folder.

Next, link the CSS as follows:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/clear-sans.css">
```

Then call the Clear Sans font on your CSS with:

```css
.class {
  font-family: 'Clear Sans', sans-serif;
}
```

### Via package managers

NPM:

```bash
$ npm install clear-sans-webfont
```

Bower:

```bash
$ bower install clear-sans-webfont
```

### Via RawGit CDN

To include the CSS files through a CDN link, use the following HTML.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/resir014/Clear-Sans-Webfont/v1.1.1/css/clear-sans.css">
```

**Heads up:** The files are hosted on [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/)'s CDN, which is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees. It is highly preferred that you manually host the files yourself.
